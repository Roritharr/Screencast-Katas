This code is designed to solve the "Game of Life Code Kata" (Code to simulate Conway's Game of Life). There is an accompanying screencast demonstrating how it was created: http://vimeo.com/34732838

If you want to run the code and tests, you'll need to install Python 2.6, (http://python.org) and py.test, (http://pytest.org/latest/).

Then execute:

py.test game_of_life.py
